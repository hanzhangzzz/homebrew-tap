  caveats <<~EOS
    The app is signed with a self-signed certificate and is not notarized, so macOS
    blocks the first launch: open System Settings → Privacy & Security and click
    "Open Anyway" once.

    Homebrew only loads casks from taps you trust. If you have not done so yet:

      brew trust hanzhangzzz/tap

    It needs a logged-in `claude` CLI and a supported terminal (see the README).
